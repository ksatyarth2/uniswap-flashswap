# uniswap-flash-swapper
An abstraction for UniswapV2 flash swaps.
Enables the user to borrow any token and repay using any other token.
Abstracts away most of the nitty-gritty details of the UniswapV2 core contracts.

## Warning
These contracts have not been audited. Be careful.

## How to use
1. Inherit the `UniswapFlashSwapper` contract into your contract.
2. Override the `execute` function to do whatever you want.
3. Call the `startSwap` function, telling it:
  - The address of the token you want to borrow (`_tokenBorrow`) -- use the zero address for ETH
  - How much of that token you want (`_amount`)
  - The address of the token you want to use to pay back the loan (`_tokenPay`) -- use the zero address for ETH
  - Any custom `_userData` you want to be made available to you in the `execute` function

### Example 1

```
pragma solidity 0.5.17;

import './UniswapFlashSwapper.sol';

contract ExampleContract is UniswapFlashSwapper {

    function flashSwap(address _tokenBorrow, uint256 _amount, address _tokenPay, bytes calldata _userData) external {
        
        // Start the flash swap
        // This will borrow _amount of the requested _tokenBorrow token for this contract and then 
        // run the `execute` function below
        startSwap(_tokenBorrow, _amount, _tokenPay, _userData);
        
    }
    
    // @notice This is where your custom logic goes
    // @dev When this code executes, this contract will hold _amount of _tokenBorrow
    function execute(address _tokenBorrow, uint _amount, address _tokenPay, uint _amountToRepay, bytes memory _userData) internal {
        // do whatever you want here
        // <insert arbitrage, liquidation, CDP collateral swap, etc>
        // be sure this contract is holding at least _amountToRepay of the _tokenPay tokens before this functions finishes executing
        // DO NOT pay back the flash loan in this function -- that will be handled for you automatically
    }
    
}
```

### Example 2

See the [`Example.sol` contract](https://github.com/Austin-Williams/uniswapv2-flash-loan-template/blob/master/Example.sol) for a more complete example that should work on mainnet.

## Testnet
If you want to test this on Rinkeby instead of mainnet, you'll need to change [these two lines](https://github.com/Austin-Williams/uniswap-flash-swapper/blob/master/UniswapFlashSwapper.sol#L12-L13) in order to use the correct WETH and DAI addresses for Rinkeby.
